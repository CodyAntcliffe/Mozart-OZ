CS-4411(Programming Languages) Assignments

This is a collection of my assignments for the CS-4411: Programming Languages course.

I wanted to post these assignments as a way to assist others who are either taking a similar course, or who are also starting out with the OZ programming language.
It wasn't very easy to find many examples through my quick Google searches, and approaching this language after coming from a a mostly Object Oriented background isn't easy.

These are my first (and likely only) attempts at writing in the language, so don't assume my approach is the correct one.  Simply use these as a way to understand the language.

#Getting Set Up
The easiest way to run these files(and to write your own) is to use GNU Emacs, configured for Mozart-OZ. The Windows installation steps can be found here:
